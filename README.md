# Blood-Pressure-Mini-Project
Analysis of Diabetes and Oxygen Saturation Data (Blood Pressure)

## Diabetes Data Analysis
- Identified key factors for diabetes (Glucose, BMI, Age) through correlation analysis and linear regression.
- Built a logistic regression model to predict diabetes with these factors.
- Evaluated model performance using cross-validation and explored alternative models (KNN).

## Oxygen Saturation Data Analysis
- Explored the oxygen saturation data distribution.
- Estimated data spread (total deviance) and bias using bootstrap methods.
- Compared methods for estimating a data property (potentially variance) and found agreement.
